# Website for project "Fünf Minuten"

Built this website for friends who participate with their microproject in Chemnitz' attempt to become "Europäische Kulturhauptstadt 2025".

Very simple website with a contact form that saves data into a MariaDB database. Used PHP as it was a requirement of the web hosting service.

Find the live website running under https://fuenfminuten.eu/
